## Reflection (STAR)
**Situation:** I wanted to understand how my personality affects my learning and teamwork style.  
**Task:** To interpret my personality test results and apply them to my academic life.  
**Action:** I read about how introverts can still be effective communicators and team members.  
**Result:** I learned ways to contribute better in group work without needing to speak first.
